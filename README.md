### Hi there 👋

I'm a self-taught UI/UX designer, with a strong interest in user-centred design and a passion for creating intuitive & visually appealing interfaces. Inspired to learn and evolve in the design industry as I believe learning never ends.
Over the years, I have developed a strong understanding of design principles, design thinking, and design softwares such as Figma & Sketch. I have had the opportunity to work on several design projects, including website design/redesigns, mobile applications and landing pages, across web3, Fintech and Edutech.
I have also worked collaboratively with cross-functional teams, including developers and project managers, to ensure the success of each project.
Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/hackinsync">@hackinsync</a> with <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jedstroke">friend</a>, and open for more opportunities.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to collaborate more with developer, cross-functional teams, UI/UX, and more.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on developers, makers, builders, creators, and more.
