### Hi there 👋

I'm a self-taught UI/UX designer, with a strong interest in user-centered design and a passion for creating intuitive & visually appealing interfaces. Inspired to learn and evolve in the design industry as I believe learning never ends.
Over the years, I have developed a strong understanding of design principles, design thinking, and design software such as Figma & Sketch. I have had the opportunity to work on several design projects, including website design/redesigns, mobile applications, and landing pages, across Web3, Fintech, and Edutech.
I have also worked collaboratively with cross-functional teams, including developers and project managers, to ensure the success of each project.
Here are some ideas to get you started:


- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate with developers, makers, builders, creators, and more.
